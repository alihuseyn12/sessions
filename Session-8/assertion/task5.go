//Homework 3: Type Assertions and Type Switches
//Task 5: Type Assertions
//
//Write a program where you define an empty interface any and assign values of different types (e.g., int, string, float64) to it.
//Use type assertions to detect the underlying types and print different messages depending on the type.
//Expected Output:
//
//Value is of type int: 42
//Value is of type string: GoLang
//Value is of type float64: 3.1415
